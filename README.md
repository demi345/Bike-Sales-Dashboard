Project Overview:

I used Excel to analyze bike sales data, applied several techniques to clean, summarize, and visualize the information. 

Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, special characters, spaces, and reformatting columns for accurate analysis.
Custom Columns: Created Age Brackets to categorize customers and gain deeper insights into sales trends across different age groups.
Pivot Tables & Charts: Used pivot tables to aggregate data, and created charts and graphs to visually present the data.
Dashboard with Slicers: Built an interactive dashboard allowing users to filter and explore the data by categories like Merital Status, Region and Education. 

Key Insights:

Income and Gender:
Males have a higher average income ($60,124) compared to females, which correlates with higher bike purchases.
Females earn about 7% less on average than males.

Age and Bike Purchases:
The Middle-Age Group (31-54 years) purchased 4 times more bikes than the Adolescent and Old Age groups.
This suggests that people in the middle age bracket likely have more disposable income, influencing higher bike sales.
