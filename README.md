In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of bike sales data using Microsoft Excel. The goal was to clean, summarize, and visualize the data to uncover meaningful insights into customer purchasing behavior.

Key Steps:

Data Cleaning:
I began by removing duplicates, special characters, and extra spaces from the dataset to ensure accuracy. Columns were reformatted as needed for consistency, which paved the way for reliable analysis.

Custom Columns:
To gain deeper insights into customer demographics, I created age brackets that categorized customers into distinct groups. This segmentation allowed for targeted analysis of sales trends across different age ranges.

Pivot Tables and Charts:
I used pivot tables to aggregate the data, allowing for efficient summarization. Visual charts and graphs were created to present the data in an easy-to-understand format, highlighting key trends and comparisons.

Interactive Dashboard with Slicers:
I designed a dynamic, interactive dashboard with slicers that enabled users to filter the data by categories such as marital status, region, and education. This allowed for more flexible and user-driven exploration of the data.

Key Insights:

Income and Gender Trends:
The analysis revealed that males had a higher average income ($60,124) than females, which correlates with a higher volume of bike purchases. On average, females earned about 7% less than males, suggesting gender-based purchasing power differences.

Age Group Purchasing Behavior:
The data showed that customers in the middle-age group (31-54 years) purchased bikes at a rate 4 times higher than adolescents or older individuals. This suggests that the middle-age demographic is likely the most financially stable, with more disposable income for discretionary purchases like bikes.
